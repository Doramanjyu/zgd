I wanna tell you a story about a little kernel!\n\nThere once lived a very anxious little corn who was too scared to try anything. He wanted a better life, but never did anything to improve it\n\nOne day the kernel surfed the internet, and found a group of funny talking .jpgs! Among them was someone, I'll dub her \"Z\". You see Z was a very talented person. She'll try her best no matter what and will help others along the way. She also gives much love and support to those who follow her\n\nThe Kernel decided to take Z's example and brace himself, trying new things. And he did! With it he gained new skills, friends, and became much happier\n\nBut one day Z had to say goodbye, Much to his sadness\n\nSo to honor Z the kernel promised to keep doing what he learned from Z: Always have courage to grow and love.
