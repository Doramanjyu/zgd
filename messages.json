I really enjoy listening to your voice a lot, its always so calming to hear, especially late at night. I'm really sad that you're graduating, but its just part of life's journey isn't it? I really pray that you'll find your own form of happiness, eat lots of tasty food and excel at what you choose to do next! Once again, thank you for everything you've done these past few year and take care of yourself yeah?","image":"https://zeacornelia.com/messages/12nriDt8fkWr4xGJWPqqRXTZAVLa-TUkj"}]
