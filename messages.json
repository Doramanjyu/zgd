Thank you so much for these past 3 and a half years! ♡\n\nI wasn't here yet when you started, but I'm still glad that I get to meet you in this short amount of time. There were a lot of unforgettable memories that I'll always hold onto, deep within my heart, because they are precious, just like you are.\n\nMaaf ya, karena selama ZEA masih ada di Nijisanji, aku nggak bisa jadi seorang fan yang benar-benar suportif. As a token of my gratitude, I tried to draw you. It's not the best since I'm still learning, but I hope it's good enough to make you smile! (⁠*⁠˘⁠︶⁠˘⁠*⁠)⁠.⁠｡⁠*⁠♡\n\nIt's been a lovely adventure being a PopcornradeZ. Although I'm not good with goodbyes, I want to make sure you're leading a satisfying life, so I must bid you farewell. I wish you all the best, and I hope you will always be blessed with tons of love!\n\nAku sayaaang ZEA~ Jaga diri baik-baik ya!\nMay the stars and rainbow be your guide.","image":"https://zeacornelia.com/messages/101B57DI6KvacDAIpljcLXJEUvchKPrDA"},{"name":"Kuroshii","text":"You have no idea how much you changed me Zea, subbing you for around 3 years or so and being in your membership for around 2 years is something i'll never forget, you changed the very being of a person called \"Kuroshii\" who just wanted to enjoy stuffs and be done with it and not proceeding with anything because he thought it'll be just a waste of time, to someone that wants to try out new things because the Drive you gave is just so inspiring\n\nWas, Is, and forever will be, an eternal PCRZ, i'll always put this badge as a sign of honor of meeting you. \n\ni will never forget, the change and courage you gave me to try out the gift i gave you 8 months ago, that will forever mark my biggest anxiety and also my biggest satisfaction i can get and it's all thanks to you\n\nSo i'll take this core memory with me\nTo the ever-changing future (hehe, last line of the first song you sing when you debuted)\n\nYou better be happy as well ! i won't forgive you if you don't !\n","image":null},{"name":"PEB","text":"Halo Jeje, \n\nMakasih untuk 3,5 tahunnya.
